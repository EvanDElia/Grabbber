# Grabbber Settings
Once the plugin is installed and activated, you can view the settings under Settings -> Grabbber Settings. These include listing tags you wish to search for when accessing the Dribble API. By default, Grabbber will look for Dribbble shots with the tag "free" and will create posts as drafts whenever it finds a new shot.
